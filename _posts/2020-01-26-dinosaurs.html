<p>I've finally customized <a href="https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll">Jekyll theme</a> the way I like it, and not shy to upload it to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.</p>
<p>Probably in near future I will make post about discord.py Battleship game bot.</p>
